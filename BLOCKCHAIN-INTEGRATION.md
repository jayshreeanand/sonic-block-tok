# BlockTok Blockchain Integration Status

## Overview

The BlockTok application has been integrated with the Solana blockchain to support content tracking, NFT minting, and royalty distribution. This document outlines the components created, their current status, and next steps to complete the integration.

## Components Created

### 1. Blockchain Client

- Created `BlocktokClient.ts` to interact with the deployed Solana program
- Implemented methods for:
  - Content initialization
  - Content retrieval
  - Analytics tracking
  - NFT minting
  - Royalty distribution setup

### 2. Wallet Integration

- Created `WalletProviders.tsx` for Solana wallet adapter integration
- Supports multiple wallet providers (Phantom, Solflare, Torus)

### 3. Blockchain Provider

- Created `BlockchainProvider.tsx` to provide application-wide access to the blockchain client
- Handles wallet connection state
- Initializes the client when a wallet is connected

### 4. UI Components

- Created content upload form (`ContentForm.tsx`)
- Created content detail view with NFT minting functionality (`content/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Created content dashboard view (`dashboard/page.tsx`)

### 5. Program IDL

- Defined the BlockTok program interface in `blocktok-idl.ts`
- Structured to match the deployed program at `3jf8o4DHcTUg71tpP7PdRFGyBrfFKW2H6LBstCfs5vqz`

## Current Status

### What's Working

- ✅ Component structure is in place
- ✅ Blockchain client implementation is complete
- ✅ UI components for content management are implemented
- ✅ Wallet connection flow is implemented

### What's Not Working

- ❌ Dependencies are not installed due to Node.js environment issues
- ❌ Build errors are present due to missing dependencies

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Node.js Installation**

   - Follow instructions in `DEPENDENCIES.md` to fix Node.js/icu4c issues

2. **Install Dependencies**

   - Install UI components: `@radix-ui/react-slot`, `@radix-ui/react-label`, etc.
   - Install Solana dependencies: `@coral-xyz/anchor`, `@solana/wallet-adapter-*`, etc.

3. **Test Wallet Connection**

   - Ensure wallets can connect to the application
   - Verify that the BlocktokClient initializes correctly

4. **Test Content Creation Flow**

   - Create content via the upload form
   - Verify it's stored on the Solana blockchain

5. **Test NFT Minting**

   - View content details and mint an NFT
   - Verify the NFT is created on-chain

6. **Test Analytics Updates**
   - Add likes, comments, shares, and views to content
   - Verify analytics are updated on-chain

## Connection to the Deployed Program

The BlockTok client is configured to connect to the deployed Solana program at:

```
3jf8o4DHcTUg71tpP7PdRFGyBrfFKW2H6LBstCfs5vqz
```

This address is set as the default program ID in the client. The environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOCKTOK_PROGRAM_ID` can be used to override this default.

## Handling Transactions

All blockchain transactions in the UI components include:

1. Loading state management
2. Error handling with user-friendly messages
3. Success notifications

## Testing Environment

The integration is configured to use Solana's devnet by default. To test:

1. Ensure your wallet is configured for devnet
2. Acquire devnet SOL from a faucet
3. Connect your wallet to the application

## Production Deployment Considerations

Before deploying to production:

1. Update RPC endpoint to a production-grade provider
2. Consider connecting to mainnet-beta instead of devnet
3. Ensure API keys are properly secured
4. Add comprehensive error handling for production scenarios
