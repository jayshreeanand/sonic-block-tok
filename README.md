```env
# AI Services
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=
RUNWAY_API_KEY=

# Blockchain
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOCKTOK_PROGRAM_ID=3jf8o4DHcTUg71tpP7PdRFGyBrfFKW2H6LBstCfs5vqz
```

## Deployment

```

## Solana Smart Contracts

The project includes two implementations of Solana smart contracts for NFT minting, content tracking, and monetization:

### 1. Vanilla Solana Implementation (src/contracts/blocktok/)

Pure Rust implementation using Solana's native programming model.

**Features:**

- Content management with metadata and analytics tracking
- NFT minting for digital content
- Royalty distribution mechanism
- On-chain content verification

**Building and Deploying:**

```bash
# Using Solana CLI
cd src/contracts/blocktok
cargo build-bpf
solana program deploy --url devnet target/deploy/blocktok.so
```

### 2. Anchor Framework Implementation (src/contracts/anchor-blocktok/)

Same functionality implemented using the Anchor framework for improved developer experience.

**Features:**

- Simplified account validation
- Structured data handling with Anchor's macros
- Automatic PDA derivation and validation
- Built-in error types with custom messages

**Building and Deploying:**

```bash
# Using Anchor
cd src/contracts/anchor-blocktok
anchor build
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
```

### Deployed Program

The Anchor-based BlockTok program is currently deployed on Solana devnet at the following address:

```

## ðŸ”’ Environment Setup

To use the video generation feature, you need to set up the following environment variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_VADOO_API_KEY=your_vadoo_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

You can add these to a `.env.local` file in the root of the project.

## Project Architecture

The project follows a modern Next.js architecture with:

- App Router for routing
- Server Components for improved performance
- Server Actions for backend functionality
- Client Components for interactive elements

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blocktok-ai.git
cd blocktok-ai
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file with your API keys:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_VADOO_API_KEY=your_vadoo_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

If you encounter Node.js dependency issues on macOS (e.g., missing libraries like `libicui18n.67.dylib`), you can use our helper script:

```bash
chmod +x run-dev.sh
./run-dev.sh
```

This script will install nvm, set up the correct Node.js version, and run the development server.

## Deployment

The app is optimized for deployment on Vercel, but can be deployed to any platform that supports Next.js applications.

## Future Roadmap

- **Enhanced AI Models**: Integration with more advanced video generation models
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Allow multiple creators to collaborate on videos
- **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed insights for creators about audience engagement
- **Multi-chain Support**: Expand beyond Sonic to other EVM-compatible chains
- **Mobile Apps**: Native mobile applications for iOS and Android
